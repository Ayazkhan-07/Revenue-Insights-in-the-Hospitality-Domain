# AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data for AtliQ Hotels to uncover key business insights related to occupancy, revenue, room performance, and booking trends.
The goal is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions using structured analysis and clear metrics.

## Problem Statement

**AtliQ Hotels wants to understand:**

How bookings and revenue vary across cities and hotels
Room category performance
Occupancy trends over time
Factors affecting revenue and utilization
This analysis answers those questions using real-world hospitality datasets.

## Datasets Used

**The project uses 5 CSV files:**

dim_hotels.csv – Hotel details (city, property name, category)
dim_rooms.csv – Room category details
fact_aggregated_bookings.csv – Aggregated booking metrics
fact_bookings.csv – Transaction-level booking data

## Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas – Data cleaning & transformation
NumPy – Numerical operations
Jupyter Notebook – Analysis & documentation

## Key Analysis Performed
